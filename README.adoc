== Overview

(Temporary) Project URL: https://github.com/lwbt/ts_build_test

[TIP]
====

.This might be a good introduction to GitHub Actions.
[%collapsible]
=====
The entire functionality here is just one
link:.github/workflows/build.yaml[GitHub Actions Workflow file].

Read mode about it link:DOCS/PIPELINE.adoc[here].
=====
====

=== Motivation

Provide automated builds of Tailscale as described in https://tailscale.com/kb/1207/small-tailscale[KB: Small Tailscale] for embedded devices.

* Building a combined binary of `tailscale` and `tailscaled`
* Using the build option `--extra-small`
* Compressing the binary with UPX

== Do it yourself

=== Costs

* https://github.com/settings/billing/summary[Billing Summary] -- Pipeline minutes and packages
* https://github.com/settings/billing/spending_limit[Spending Limits] -- By default it should have a spending limit of 0, so you will not get billed but the functionalities will stop working when exceeding a limit. I have to figure out by myself how much on an impact this has, a I currently interpret it, I won't hit the monthly pipeline minutes limit and outgoing data transfer for public packages seems to be free?

Pipeline consumption:

* You can run the check every hour which takes about 30 seconds
* If a build is created it will take about a total of 7 minutes, 2 minutes per architecture, and you will be "billed" 7 minutes, which means you will have 7 minutes left to use this month

=== Notifications

If you clone the repository and run the workflow on your account, you will
receive email from GitHub when a new release was created. You will also see
that, while the cron definition says run every hour at 00 Minutes, that a
runner will sometimes start and complete a few minutes later.

=== Fork

TODO

=== Re-create

Here are the basic individual steps if you don't want to fork:

[source,bash]
----
# Login to GitHub (necessary on the first run)
gh auth login -h github.com -p HTTPS -w

# Create a new repo on GitHub
REPO="ts_build_test"
gh repo create ${REPO} --private

# Verify that the new repo exists
gh repo list

# TODO
# Do a git clone of the new repo here? GH already gives you the URL.

# Create folder structure for workflows
mkdir -pv .github/workflows

# TODO
# Do a git push of the new repo here?
----

=== Required Settings

Setting -> Actions -> General -> Workflow permissions
-> "Read and write permissions"
(default: "Read repository contents and packages permissions")

[source,bash]
----
