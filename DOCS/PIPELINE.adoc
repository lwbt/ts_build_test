== Overview

This might be a good introduction to GitHub Actions.

The entire functionality here is just one
link:../.github/workflows/build.yaml[GitHub Actions Workflow file].

There is a simpler workflow you can start with: link:../.github/workflows/build_simple.yaml-disabled[]

// TODO
== TODO

* Add SBOM as described in: https://github.com/microsoft/sbom-tool/blob/main/docs/setting-up-github-actions.md
** https://github.com/${OWNER}/${REPO}/network/dependencies[] (link:../../../network/dependencies[relative link]) offers an SBOM file, is this the same? Does this make sense?

== Tools

For maintenance, if something breaks, use these tools:

* https://rhysd.github.io/actionlint/[Playground] from https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint
* https://github-actions-hero.vercel.app/[Tutorial] for GitHub Actions

== Resource usage and cost

TODO

== Security

Go to
https://github.com/${OWNER}/${REPO}/settings/actions
(link:../../../settings/actions[relative link])
and select:
Actions permissions -> **Allow `OWNER`, and select non-`OWNER`, actions and reusable workflows**.
Enable **Allow actions created by GitHub**.
Add `ncipollo/release-action@v*` to **Allow specified actions and reusable workflows**.

TODO: Find a way to do this with `gh`.
