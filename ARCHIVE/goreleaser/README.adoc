== Overview

This was my second attempt building the workflow and the first attempt using GoReleaser.
I have not gotten this to work yet, therefore I'm archiving it to start were I have left off when I decide to give this another try.

`github_workflows_deployment.yaml` is meant to be saved under `.github/workflows/deployment.yaml`.

== Work log / tasks completed

* Ran `goreleaser init` and `goreleaser check` in `cmd/tailscaled` directory of
  Tailscale source repository, as suggested by https://goreleaser.com/quick-start/
** Result saved as `.goreleaser_ts_init.yaml`
* Put `main: ./cmd/tailscaled` under `builds:` to use `.goreleaser.yaml` in the
  root of the Tailscale source repository, as suggested by
  https://goreleaser.com/customization/builds/
* Added section for UPX to `.goreleaser.yaml`
* Fetch and review `.goreleaser.yaml` from Chezmoi

== Reference Code and Documentation

Tailscale documentation and code:

* https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/blob/main/.github/workflows/test.yml#L110
* https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/blob/main/build_dist.sh[] -- The script you are supposed to use building binaries for distribution and playing fair with people in the community when other users ask questions
* Small Tailscale documentation page: https://tailscale.com/kb/1207/small-tailscale[]
* Static builds comparison: https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/#static[]

A few selected projects using GoReleaser:

* GitHub CLI (gh): https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/v2.47.0/.github/workflows/deployment.yml[] -- The cleanest example I found so far
* Chezmoi: https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml[] -- Does a lot more than I was looking for while not giving the answers to get what I was looking for.
** https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/blob/master/.goreleaser.yaml[] -- This is the file I used and trimmed down to get link:.goreleaser.yaml[]
* Gum:
** https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum/blob/main/.github/workflows/goreleaser.yml
** https://github.com/charmbracelet/meta/blob/main/.github/workflows/goreleaser.yml
** This was more complexity than expected, I was looking for a simple solution under 100 lines of code.
